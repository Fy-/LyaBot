#LyaBot - A "smart" chatbot
First, this is not like a real project or anything it was more like a learning experiencce for me at that's why I decided to make this repo public. 
The code is based and inspired by multiple projects like:
- https://github.com/chiphuyen/stanford-tensorflow-tutorials/tree/master/assignments/chatbot
- https://gist.github.com/higepon/eb81ba0f6663a57ff1908442ce753084 (that's what motivated me to start)
- https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/nmt-chatbot
- https://github.com/bshao001/ChatLearner/
- And of course  https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt
